What is Broker

  Broker is also called Kafka server. It's managing topics and checking the Consumer groups and so on. Confluent recommends one cluster has three brokers at least. It makes your data safer. Kafka uses Zookeeper to do leadership election of Kafka Broker. Zookeeper sends changes of the topology to Kafka, so each node in the cluster knows when a new broker joined, a Broker died, a topic was removed or a topic was added, etc. The Broker that has leadership is called Controller. Controller chooses the leader partition from the replicated partitions.


Topic

  Topic is a category of the messages. Producers send messages with a topic and Consumers reads the messages with the topic. The Broker allocates partitions to consumers in a round-robin strategy(default configuration). It is the most efficient to have as many partitions as the number of consumers.

Offset

  One message unit is called a record. The ID of the record is Offset. The Offset consists of an integer number and each topic partition has the different offsets. The producer publishes a message and then the offset is increased one. For example, the producer publishes three messages and the broker processed it successfully, the offset likes this:

  </a>

  After reading the message on the topic, the consumer marks it as committed. When the consumers re-read the messages from the topic, it continues reading the messages from the last committed position.

  </a>

  The figure above shows the consumer read the 2182 offset and committed. And next time, the consumer will read the message from 2183 offset. Using the offset, Kafka guarantees the order of the messages. But, this guarantee is only in the same partition.

Topic Partition

  A topic can have multiple partitions. Topic partition, it's like pipe line. The pipe lines(partitions) are connected from the broker to consumers. The messages flows in the pipe lines and each consumer receives the messages.

    <img src="//soontaeklim.github.io/assets/images/kafka02-03.png" title="kafka02-03">
  </a>

  For example, topic A has three partitions and the producer sends the message 1. The message will go to partition1 and next message will go to partition2 and next go to partition3. Kafka doesn't guarantee the order for the partitions. But if the message has the key value, it's always going throw the same partition until the number of partitions is changed. So, if the order of the messages is important, you have to set the key value. Or you can set a custom partitioner on the producer.


Replication

  One partition is stored on the disk of one broker node. If the broker has a failure, it's possible to lose the data. For avoiding this problem, Kafka uses the replication feature. When you create a topic, you need to set the 'replication-factor' option. Replication-factor is 3 means there are three same partitions in the cluster. And each partition will be on the different broker nodes. So, when you create a topic, the number of brokers should be greater than the replication-factor value or equal.

  </a>

  This figure shows there are three broker nodes and the replication-factor is two. If  Broker 1 is down, we still have partition 1 on Broker2 and partition 3 on Broker3. But if Broker 2 is also down, we can't read partition 1. Confluent recommends having 5 or more brokers and 3 or more replications for the critical system.One of the replications will be the leader partition. It's elected by Controller. and others will be follower. Producer and Consumer can access only the leader partition. Followers sync the data with the leader partition. The synced follower is called ISR(In-Sync-Replica). If the leader partition has some problem, one of the ISR is elected by the controller as a new leader partition.

Do you know Franz Kafka? He is a famous German novelist who was born in Prague and was a German-speaking Bohemian. 
But the thing that I will mention here is not about Franz Kafka. It is a project for message publishing. 
This project was originally developed by LinkedIn for processing log messages. 
And the project team established a company called Confluent and now this project is donated to the Apache Software Foundation.

Then, let's take a look at what Kafka is in earnest.
Kafka is called the Pub-Sub(Publish-Subscribe) system. Because the producers publish the messages and the consumers subscribe to get the messages.
Why does Kafka have this structure? Let's take the following images.

</a> 

A is a server that creates messages and we make the metric data from the messages. We can make this system easily. 
The metric processing system is connected with Server A directly. And then we will add a server called B. It's still simple because we just have two servers and one metric system.
But if we have more servers or need to make another metric system, it will be complicated like the last image.

One of the solutions is Pub-Sub system. In the middle of the network, there is a Pub-Sub system that manages the messages. 
The servers that publish the messages connect only with the Pub-Sub. And also the metric processing systems connect the Pub-Sub system and consume the messages. The system structure is like this:

</a> 

Now our system is simpler. But we still have problems. If we need to get other data from the servers, we need more Pub-Sub system.
This makes our system to be complicated again. Apache Kafka manages this with topics. If you need more throughput, you can extend brokers and consumers quickly. These are the biggest benefit of using Kafka. 
This project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. 

Next, we will take a closer look at what are Broker, Topic and what Producer does and what Consumer does.

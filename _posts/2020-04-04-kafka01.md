Do you know Franz Kafka? He is a famous German novelist who was born in Prague and was a German-speaking Bohemian. 
But the thing that I will mention here is not about Franz Kafka. It is a project for message publishing. 
This project was originally developed by LinkedIn for processing log messages. 
And the project team established a company called Confluent and now this project is donated to the Apache Software Foundation.

Then, let's take a look at what Kafka is in earnest.
Kafka is called the Pub-Sub(Publish-Subscribe) system. Because the producers publish the messages and the consumers subscribe to get the messages.
Why does Kafka have this structure? Let's take the following images.
